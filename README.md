# GdTool
GdTool is a standalone commannd line tool for reverse engineering games made with the Godot engine.
It has both a compiler and a decompiler for all release GdScript versions (before GdScript 2.0, which is currently unreleased).
GdTool has no dependencies on the Godot engine and works as a lightweight toolset written with .NET 5.0.
